# Greeting :)
Hi there! This is some kind of "Behind The Scene" again(?). After i made this EP, I'm just thinking of quitting coding "but" I still got some promise that I had made to myself that this year. So this might be my last year of coding before I got quit :frowning:

# okay.. This is a really content part
Before I start, I should told you that in this EP I proudly presented my loved distributor "DistroKid" even if I pay them about 36 USD/yr. and it automatically cut my bank's balance 🥲

This album named "Love, In love & Heartbroken" because of mood & tone of this EP is a mix of my emotion in about 3-4 months that I just in love someone, be loved by someone and just got dumb by someone in that short amount of time :frowning:

and in this EP songs's name is listed as
 - I
 - Want To
 - Be
 - With U
 - At least in my dream.

That because I think that this EP is good to try making a song with one sentence & have a various mood in every songs.

Okay! Now I'll explain my song in each of it 😄

## I

> This song is representing as a moment that someone still waiting for love from their One-sided love and still waiting there to see her everyday :(

## Want To
#### ([Videos Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoCCx_jHki4))
> This is the one that I proudly presented because this might be the first and the last song that I wrote about myself when I'm in love. This song made out of the feeling like "Oh, I want to drive a Container Truck with Concert props inside to her house and play it in front of your house" LMAO. 
> (And I keep my girl inside this song too :))

## Be
#### ([Videos Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmku38Fit78))
> This song is representing as a moment you have been a long-distance love and you want to take care of her in every moment. It's like a hard moment thats you want to take care her but she's tooooooo far away. So you can just send her this song. 🥺

## With U (ft. [กบ VtuberTH](https://www.youtube.com/@Kirin1207))
#### ([Videos Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM1gUvsPa-Y))
> This song is representing as a moment that you have been with your GF but she still miss her Ex. So I just write this song up of this :(

## At least in my dream. (ft. [Anxiowaldosiaticist](https://www.youtube.com/@anxiowaldosiaticist))
#### ([Videos Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MB_4cZIIFM))
> This is the last song of this EP that I wrote up with a time about 2 hours before I'm going to meet my friend. Unfortunately, this song is about my latest time I got dumped while I'm having depression from my recently works. So This song is representing as a time when you just got dumped by your GF but you just completely draw a future about her.


# Conclusion
Trust me this EP is a mixture of my real feeling when I'm in love, be loved and got dumped. So this is kind of my real emotion that I put all of it into my songs. :)
